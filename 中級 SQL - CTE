___ match_list ___ (
    SELECT

  		___
    FROM match
    WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10)
-- Select league and count of matches from the CTE
SELECT
    l.name AS league,
    COUNT(match_list.id) AS matches
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE to the league table
LEFT JOIN ___ ON l.id = ___
GROUP BY l.name;
